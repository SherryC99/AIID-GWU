## 5. Results/Conclusions/Recommendations
Upon completion of the analysis, the project will present insights into the changing trends and rhetoric in AI journalism. The findings will highlight shifts in media attention towards different AI topics, changes in sentiment surrounding AI harms, and variations in reporting styles across different publications. For example, there may be fluctuations in the frequency of certain terms or the prevalence of positive/negative sentiment in reporting on AI incidents.These insights will not only benefit the AI Incident Database (AIID) but also provide valuable information for stakeholders in AI safety, governance, and compliance. Understanding these sentiment patterns provides valuable insights into public perception and media discourse surrounding AI.Our analysis underscores the dynamic nature of AI journalism, influenced by various factors such as technological advancements, public discourse, and media narratives.

Recognizing these dynamics is essential for accurately capturing and indexing AI-related incidents in databases like AIID.Contextual understanding is crucial when interpreting media coverage of AI incidents. While sentiment analysis provides valuable insights, considering the broader context in which these sentiments are expressed is essential. This includes factors such as the tone of the article, the credibility of the source, and the specific circumstances surrounding the incident.Continuous monitoring and adaptation are recommended due to the dynamic nature of AI journalism. This involves regularly updating sentiment analysis models, refining topic modeling techniques, and staying informed about emerging trends in media coverage. Collaboration with industry experts ensures that our analysis accurately reflects the complexities of AI-related incidents portrayed in the media. To capture nuanced shifts in reporting, further investment in advanced NLP techniques is advised. These techniques offer the potential to provide more detailed insights into sentiment, language usage, and thematic trends in AI journalism.


## 6. Potential Next Steps section 
Potential next steps include refining the analysis to uncover deeper insights, exploring additional NLP techniques.Explore ensemble modeling approaches to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy.Recommendations may also be made for improving the indexing of incident reports in the AIID and tracking discourse about AI and related harm more effectively.Expand the scope of data collection to include a broader range of sources, languages, and regions. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of global perspectives on AI-related incidents and trends.Explore techniques for detecting and mitigating biases in media coverage of AI incidents. This could involve developing algorithms to identify biased language, assessing the impact of bias on public perception, and implementing strategies to promote balanced reporting.Analyzing cross-domain influences on media coverage can provide a more holistic understanding of the socio-cultural factors shaping perceptions of AI.


## 7. Risk Considerations section
One potential risk is that the dataset may not contain sufficient information to adequately answer the research questions. In such cases, adjustments to the scope of the analysis or exploration of additional data sources may be necessary. Risk of bias in media reporting may influence the accuracy of sentiment analysis and trend identification.Ethical considerations arise regarding data privacy and consent in analyzing journalistic content. Additionally, potential challenges exist in interpreting and contextualizing findings within the broader landscape of AI research and development.Other risk considerations include the potential for algorithmic biases in the NLP model used for sentiment analysis, the risk of misinterpretation of results due to complex linguistic nuances, and the possibility of unintended consequences stemming from recommendations based on the analysis. Furthermore, there may be risks associated with relying solely on media reports for data analysis, such as incomplete or inaccurate information leading to flawed conclusions. 


## 8. Appendices
Links to the data used, code developed for the analysis, and any additional resources relevant to the project will be included in the appendices for reference. This ensures transparency and reproducibility of the analysis and allows for further exploration.Links to relevant literature and resources consulted during the project will also be included. Moreover, appendices might contain data dictionaries or schemas explaining the structure and meaning of the datasets used, along with any additional supplementary materials such as presentation slides,repository files etc. created for dissemination purposes.
